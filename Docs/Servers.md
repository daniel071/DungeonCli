# Multiplayer

## Getting started:
1. Install RethinkDB from [here](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/)
2. Run RethinkDB and create a new table called `chat`
3. Now you can type `multiplayer` in DungeonCli. It will ask for a server ip,
search "What's my IP" and you should know it.
4. If you want people to join from other networks, port forward `28015`
from your router settings.
5. You're done! Have fun playing with other players.
