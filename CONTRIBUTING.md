# Contributing on DungeonCli
Thanks for deciding to contribute to DungeonCli!

## Translations
If you want to add translations, please open up an issue
and we will implement it in.

## How to make a pull request
You can create a fork of this, create changes to the fork and then open a
pull request, and one of the maintainers will review your code. If it's
good we'll accept it.

## Programming
If you want to add an extra feature make sure to test your code before
opening a pull request.

Please try and use Python PEP8 styling and camelCase for variables, functions
and class names. Use intuitive names and make sure that your
feature doesn't break anything else.

For people with write permission to the master branch, feel free to
commit directly to master for small changes and bug fixes however,
if you are adding a major feature or update, it is recommended to
create a pull request instead so others can review your code.
